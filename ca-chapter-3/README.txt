	CA/Chapter 3

CA can only be used on a Macintosh computer using System X (non-Intel based) with Macintosh Common Lisp 5.0 available from digitool.com. 

To load CA, place the ca-chapter-3 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application and then load the init.lisp file from that folder from within MCL ("Load File" from the "File" menu). Alternatively, you can pull the init.lisp from the ca-chapter-3 folder, place it alongside MCL 5.0 and then simply boot MCL 5.0 and CA should load automatically (as long as you've placed the ca-chapter-3 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application). You should then read the instructions in the header to the CA file.
You'll have to cut and past instructions such as "(create-cellular-automata 262 186)" with parentheses into the Listener window and press return.
