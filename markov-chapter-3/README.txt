    Markov/Chapter 3

Markov can be used on any computer which supports a Common Lisp (which virtually means any computer). To run Markov, open and load the file from within the Common Lisp you've chosen and carefully read the instructions in the header to the file. In most cases you'll have to cut and paste an instruction such as "(compose-new-music-based-on-markovian-probabilities 60 5 '((0 60 1000 1 127) (0 60 1000 1 127) (1000 62 1000 1 127) (2000 64 1000 1 127) (3000 65 1000 1 127) (4000 67 1000 1 127) (5000 65 1000 1 127) (6000 69 1000 1 127) (7000 71 1000 1 127) (8000 60 1000 1 127)))" with parentheses into a Listener-type window and press return. Most Common Lisps (even free ones) have associated manuals or help menus which will also be of use. 

Markov can also be used on a Macintosh computer using System X (non-Intel based) with Macintosh Common Lisp 5.0 available from digitool.com by also loading the "play-midi-QT.lisp" file. To load the Mac version of Markov, place the markov-chapter-3 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application and then load the Markov.lisp file from that folder from within MCL ("Load File" from the "File" menu) and then the "play-midi-QT.lisp" file in the same way.
