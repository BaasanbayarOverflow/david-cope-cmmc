    SPEAC/Chapter 7

SPEAC can only be used on a Macintosh computer using System X (non-Intel based) with Macintosh Common Lisp 5.0 available from digitool.com. 

To load SPEAC, place the speac-chapter-7 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application and then load the init.lisp file from that folder from within MCL ("Load File" from the "File" menu).

Alternatively, you can pull the init.lisp from the speac-chapter-7 folder, place it alongside MCL 5.0 and then simply boot MCL 5.0 and SPEAC should load automatically (as long as you've placed the speac-chapter-7 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application).
