This is (almost) a mirror of the source code accompanying [David Cope's][cope] book

* [*Computer Models of Musical Creativity*.][cmmc] Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. 2006.

The original source code can be found here:

*  [http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/cmmc.html][1]

It was originally intended to be run with [Macintosh Common LISP][mac-clisp].

I have adjusted some things to make the code more compatible across platforms, though this may have broken compatbility with Macintosh Common LISP:

* Line endings are LF.
* Character encoding is UTF-8.
* Readme files in plain .txt format.
* File names have been changed to avoid the '/' and ' ' characters.
