This is (almost) a mirror of the source code accompanying [David Cope's][cope] book

* [*Computer Models of Musical Creativity*.][cmmc] Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. 2006.

I have adjusted some things to make the code more compatible across platforms:

* Line endings are LF. (This may not have been a good idea.)
* Character encoding is UTF-8.
* Readme files in plain .txt format.
* File names have been changed to avoid the '/' and no ' ' characters.


The original source code can be found here:
