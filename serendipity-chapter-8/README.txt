    Serendipity/Chapter 8

Serendipity can only be used on a Macintosh computer using System X (non-Intel based) with Macintosh Common Lisp 5.0 available from digitool.com. 

To load Serendipity, place the serendipity-chapter-8 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application and then load the init.lisp file from that folder from within MCL ("Load File" from the "File" menu).  Alternatively, you can pull the init.lisp from the serendipity-chapter-8 folder, place it alongside MCL 5.0 and then simply boot MCL 5.0 and Serendipity should load automatically (as long as you've placed the serendipity-chapter-8 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application). Then paste either (serendipity) or (play-events (serendipity)) into the Listener window (depending on whether you wish to just see the musical events or hear the musical events). Be patient, depending on the availability of files of the right type, this may take some time.
