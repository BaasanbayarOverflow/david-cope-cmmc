Sorcerer can only be used on a Macintosh computer using System X (non-Intel based) with Macintosh Common Lisp 5.0 available from digitool.com. 

To load Sorcerer, place the sorcerer-chapter-5 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application and then load the init.lisp file from that folder from within MCL ("Load File" from the "File" menu).

Alternatively, you can pull the init.lisp from the sorcerer-chapter-5 folder, place it alongside MCL 5.0 and then simply boot MCL 5.0 and Sorcerer should load automatically (as long as you've placed the sorcerer-chapter-5 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application).

This version of Sorcerer uses the examples (already loaded) presented in chapter 5 of CMMC. For a more elaborate version of Sorcerer that loads other files see my Website at http://arts.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope under Software.
