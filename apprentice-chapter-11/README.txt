Apprentice can only be used on a Macintosh computer using System X (non-Intel based) with Macintosh Common Lisp 5.0 available from digitool.com. 

To load Apprentice, place the apprentice-chapter-11 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application and then load the init.lisp file from that folder from within MCL ("Load File" from the "File" menu). Alternatively, you can pull the init.lisp from the apprentice-chapter-11 folder, place it alongside MCL 5.0 and then simply boot MCL 5.0 and Apprentice should load automatically (as long as you've placed the apprentice-chapter-11 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application).
