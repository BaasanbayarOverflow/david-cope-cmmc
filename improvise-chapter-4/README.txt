    Improvise/Chapter 4

Improvise can only be used on a Macintosh computer using System X (non-Intel based) with Macintosh Common Lisp 5.0 available from digitool.com. 

To load Improvise, place the improvise-chapter-4 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application and then load the init.lisp file from that folder from within MCL ("Load File" from the "File" menu). Alternatively, you can pull the init.lisp from the improvise-chapter-4 folder, place it alongside MCL 5.0 and then simply boot MCL 5.0 and Improvise should load automatically (as long as you've placed the improvise-chapter-4 folder alongside your MCL 5.0 application).
